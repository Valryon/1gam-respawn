One game a month - January 2014
====================

**Theme: Respawn**

## The idea

"Metroid-vania" game where each death make the player stronger, bigger, faster, etc.

Game starts facing a huge enemy, spawning dozen of projectiles killing in one shot. Player is nearly forced to die.
But he respawns instantly, granted with new bonuses.

After a while the player is able to defeat the first enemy and discover a whole new level. Unlike Spore, it was just a tiny piece of a much bigger world.
